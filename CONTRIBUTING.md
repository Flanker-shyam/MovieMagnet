our PR/MRs must be created between October 1 and October 31 (in any time zone, UTC-12 thru UTC+14).

Your PR/MRs must be made to a public, unarchived repository.

PR/MRs that are labeled with a label containing the word “spam” by maintainers will not be counted.

We use the Node.js 16 RegEx engine with /\bspam\b/i to look for spam labels.

PR/MRs that also have the “hacktoberfest-accepted” label cannot be marked as spammy via a label.

PR/MRs that have been merged and do not have a label containing the word “invalid” cannot be marked as spammy via a label.

PR/MRs that our system detects as spammy will also not be counted.

Any user with two or more spammy PR/MRs will be disqualified.
